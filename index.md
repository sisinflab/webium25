## DESCRIPTION

<p align="justify">
Wearable Devices (WDs), such as smartwatches and fitness trackers, continuously produce extensive data streams that reveal valuable information about physiological states, activity patterns, and user interactions. These devices enable the construction of advanced user models, offering dynamic insights into personal routines, health trends, and behavioural tendencies. Meanwhile, Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) emerge as a transformative technology by capturing neural activity to provide unprecedented access to cognitive and
emotional states. However, BCIs are not conventionally classified as wearables; the latest technological advancements have reduced their size to resemble everyday accessories like earphones, suggesting their potential integration into wearable formats in the near future.
<br>
Despite the promise of these technologies, the full exploitation of their data for user modelling and personalization—such as optimizing activities like media consumption or interaction design—remains underexplored. The convergence of WDs and BCIs opens up new avenues for understanding the complexity of human behaviour and preferences, and this potential is amplified by the integration of Large Language Models ( LLMs). By synthesizing and interpreting multimodal datasets, LLM s can better understand the intricate interplay between physiological, cognitive, and behavioural signals, ultimately enriching user modelling processes.
Following the success of the first edition, this workshop seeks to delve into the deep impact of combining data from wearable devices, neural interfaces, and advanced machine learning models. Participants will explore the opportunities and challenges that arise in this innovative context, examining how these echnologies can be harnessed to enhance the granularity and accuracy of user models. The discussions will also address practical implications, such as ethical considerations and the necessity of privacy-aware approaches when dealing with highly sensitive physiological and neural data.
<br>
Through collaborative exchanges, the initiative aspires to chart new directions in the field, fostering novel research trajectories and interdisciplinary partnerships. The interplay of WDs, BCIs, and LLMs can redefine user modelling by creating systems that dynamically adapt to individual needs and behaviours, paving the way for transformative advancements in personalized experiences.
By drawing on cutting-edge research and practical expertise, the workshop aims to inspire innovative solutions that capitalize on these emerging synergies, advancing the boundaries of what is possible in user modelling and adaptive systems.

## OBJECTIVES <a name="OBJ"></a>

<p align="justify">
The 2nd Workshop on Wearable Devices and Brain-Computer Interfaces for User Modelling (WeBIUM) is dedicated to exploring the comprehensive utilization of data derived from Wearable Devices (WDs), Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs)
and LLM systems to elevate the user experience through enhanced user profiling and modelling. The primary aim of this workshop is to stimulate research initiatives that integrate wearable devices (WDs) and brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) to acquire real-time biological data, thereby enhancing the precision of user profiling techniques. WeBIUM is dedicated to driving advancements in user modeling methodologies, with the ultimate goal of optimizing user engagement and
satisfaction by providing personalization algorithms with highly accurate contextual and user-specific information. This mission aligns closely with the findings and perspectives outlined in recent literature. The workshop
seeks to create a platform for in-depth discussions and collaborative knowledge exchange among researchers and industry professionals, focusing on the development and application of solutions leveraging data from WDs and BCIs.
Specifically, the objectives of the workshop are to:</p>

+ Share cutting-edge research and methodologies encompassing new design technologies and evaluation approaches
+ Identify and address forthcoming challenges in the interdisciplinary realm of WDs, BCIs, and AI
+ Analysis and mitigation of emerging scientific and technological challenges involving the analysis of data from WDs and BCIs and processed through LLM
+ Recognize emerging issues that warrant attention within the broader field


<p align="justify">
By providing a place for interdisciplinary collaboration and building on the first edition’s success, the WeBIUM second edition aspires to enhance a community dedicated to leveraging WD and BCI data for user profiling. We encourage
active participation from researchers and practitioners alike, fostering an environment conducive to collaborative exploration and the exchange of innovative ideas. </p>
